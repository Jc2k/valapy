What is pyvala?
===============
Not sure yet. So far there is pycode and bindgen.

OK, what is pycode?
===================
It's a like the ccode library in Vala, but for generating python. And
it sucks.

And bindgen?
============
It takes a python VAPI file and makes a ctypes binding. Awesome sauce.
